To run:

 - Open up the Back-End project in Visual Studio, and hit Ctrl+F5
   You'll be greeted with a browser window that returns nothing, however don't worry about that, the endpoint
   this project relies on is functional

 - Open up a terminal/command-prompt window under Front-End/simple-contact-form, and run "ng-serve"

 - Hope that it works on your machine too :)
